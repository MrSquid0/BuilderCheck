## Introduction

Builder Check is a web/mobile application designed for personalized management of property 
renovations. It aims to provide real-time tracking to efficiently minimize construction time. 
The app features a management panel for the client to create a project, assign workers, and list 
tasks, which are completed with an accompanying image. It also allows for budget review and worker 
management. Workers have a panel to view and update task statuses and send budget proposals. 
The system sends push notifications for important updates. Technologies used include Flutter, 
Spring Boot, Kotlin, PostgreSQL, API services, unit tests, Git, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.
